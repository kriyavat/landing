# 📋 Ditto — Smarter Clipboard, Seamless Flow

**Ditto** is a lightning-fast, ultra-lightweight macOS menu bar utility that gives your clipboard superpowers.  
Effortlessly copy, manage, and paste multiple items — all from your keyboard.

> Like ⌘+V, but actually useful.

## ✨ Why Ditto?

Copying one item at a time is frustrating.  
Juggling multiple snippets, tokens, or notes? Even worse.

**Ditto** makes it effortless with:

- A live buffer of your last 8 clipboard items
- Full keyboard control over what and when you paste
- A heads-up display (HUD) for instant visual feedback
- A minimalist menu bar UI that stays out of your way
